*** Testing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: testing
:END:

Uses [[https://github.com/alphapapa/makem.sh][makem.sh]] for linting and running the tests. The tests are written with
[[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]]. After pushing a GitHub action is triggered to automatically lint and
run tests. The outcome can be seen on the [[https://github.com/hubisan/org-files-db/actions][Actions]] page.

**** Lint & run tests

To lint the package and run the tests locally from the command line you can use
the Makefile targets or call makem.sh directly. Make sure to build the sandbox
(~make sandbox-build~) before running the tests and to rebuild it if the
dependencies or the emacs version have changed. The main targets are:

| sandbox-build       | Creates the sandbox directory and installs the dependencies and linters in the sandbox. |
| sandbox-clean       | Removes the sandbox directory.                                                          |
| sandbox-rebuild     | Runs ~sandbox-clean~ and then ~sandbox-build~.                                          |
| sandbox-all         | Run the tests and lint the package in the sandbox.                                      |
| sandbox-lint        | Lint in the sandbox.                                                                    |
| sandbox-test        | Run the tests in the sandbox.                                                           |
| sandbox-interactive | Load the packages in the sandbox and launch Emacs (GUI).                                |

There are additional makefile targets for linting to be able to call the linters
separately:

| sandbox-lint-checkdoc | Run checkdoc. Checks for style errors.                         |
| sandbox-lint-compile  | Byte-compile source files with warnings as errors.             |
| sandbox-lint-declare  | Run check-declare.                                             |
| sandbox-lint-elsa     | Run Elsa (not included in "sandbox-lint" rule).                |
| sandbox-lint-indent   | Lint indentation.                                              |
| sandbox-lint-package  | Run package-lint, a linting library for elisp package metadata |
| sandbox-lint-regexps  | Relint scans elisp files for mistakes in regexps.              |

To increase the verbosity add ~v=v~ or ~v=vv~ before or after the target like
~make v=vv sandbox-all~.
