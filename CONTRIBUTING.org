*** Testing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: testing
:END:

Uses [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev][Eldev]] which needs to be [[https://github.com/doublep/eldev#installation][installed]]. The tests are written with [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][Buttercup]].
After pushing GitHub an action is triggered to automatically lint and run tests.
The outcome can be seen on the [[https://github.com/hubisan/org-files-db/actions][Actions]] page.
