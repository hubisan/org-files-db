The org-files-db package allows you to store data from Org files (headings, tags, properties, links) in a SQLite database. It supports the extraction of relevant information from specified directories or individual Org files.

Parsing Org files and inserting data into the database is done asynchronously, ensuring a non-blocking and responsive experience.

It detect changes in files periodically and updates the database automatically to keep your data synchronized. Changes made to Org files with Emacs are updated instantly.
